# Face-recognition
It will recognize the image from dataset  of real life and easily generated by us
Face-Recognition

This project illustrate how can one use deep learning libraries like dlib and use them to 
recognise the  images.

Installing Dependencies

pip install --user numpy scipy dlib


the pre-trained models
you can download from attached file or
1.Download dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat.bz2  and shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 from keggle  or github
2.Extract the two files in the same folder that you earlier created for the project, in my case it would be 'face_recognition' folder.
